## 🌟 Introduction

This repository includes the machine learning models and projects I developed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project is neatly organized in its own directory, showcasing the code and methodologies used. 

## 💼 Projects

### 🎬 Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

**File:** `Task_1(Movie_Genre_Classification).ipynb`

**Description:** Built a machine learning model to predict movie genres based on plot summaries. Employed natural language processing techniques to extract features and classify genres.

**Techniques Used:** TF-IDF

**Classifiers:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression

**Directory:** `Movie Genre Classification`

**Dataset:** Movie Genre Dataset

### 💳 Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**File:** `Task_2(CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Developed a model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data. Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE and employed decision tree-based algorithms.

**Techniques Used:** Decision Trees, SMOTE

**Directory:** `Credit Card Fraud Detection`

**Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Dataset

### 📉 Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**File:** `Task_3(CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Created a predictive model to foresee customer churn for subscription services. Utilized historical data on customer demographics and usage behavior to predict churn.

**Techniques Used:** Gradient Boosting

**Directory:** `Customer Churn Prediction`

**Dataset:** Customer Churn Dataset

### 📱 Task 4: Spam SMS Detection

**File:** `Task_4(SPAM_SMS_DETECTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Built an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Utilized text vectorization techniques like TF-IDF combined with Naive Bayes for classification.

**Techniques Used:** TF-IDF

**Classifiers:** Naive Bayes

**Directory:** `Spam SMS Detection`

**Dataset:** SMS Spam Dataset

## ⚙️ Installation

To run the notebooks locally, make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then, install the required dependencies with:
