# CodSoft Machine Learning Projects 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase various machine learning projects developed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project explores different domains and techniques in machine learning.

## Projects

### Movie Genre Classification

Predict movie genres based on plot summaries using TF-IDF and classifiers like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

- **Directory:** `Movie Genre Classification`
- **File:** `Task_1(Movie_Genre_Classification).ipynb`
- **Dataset:** Movie Genre Dataset

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

Identify fraudulent credit card transactions using decision tree algorithms and handling class imbalance with SMOTE.

- **Directory:** `Credit Card Fraud Detection`
- **File:** `Task_2(CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION).ipynb`
- **Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Dataset

### Customer Churn Prediction

Forecast customer churn for subscription services using gradient boosting on customer demographics and behavior data.
