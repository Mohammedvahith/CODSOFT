## Overview

This repository showcases the work done during my internship at CodSoft. Each task is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and involves building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

**File:** `Task_1(Movie_Genre_Classification).ipynb`

**Description:** Develops a model to classify movies into genres based on descriptions using NLP techniques and classification algorithms.

**Technologies:** NLP, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**File:** `Task_2(CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Builds a model to detect fraudulent transactions using imbalanced data handling and classification algorithms.

**Technologies:** SMOTE, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**File:** `Task_3(CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Predicts customer churn using demographic and usage data, with feature engineering and classification models.

**Technologies:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

### Task 4: Spam SMS Detection

**File:** `Task_4(SPAM_SMS_DETECTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using text vectorization and classification algorithms.

**Technologies:** Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, SVM

## Installation

To run the notebooks locally, install Python and Jupyter Notebook. Then install the required dependencies:
