## Overview

This repository showcases the work done during my internship at CodSoft. The tasks involve building and evaluating machine learning models for various applications. Each task is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing a detailed, step-by-step approach to solving the problem.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

**File:** `Task_1(Movie_Genre_Classification).ipynb`

In this task, I developed a machine learning model to classify movies into different genres based on their descriptions. The dataset used includes movie plots and corresponding genres. Various natural language processing techniques and classification algorithms were employed to achieve high accuracy.

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**File:** `Task_2(CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION).ipynb`

This task focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. I used a dataset containing transaction details labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The goal was to build a model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions, using techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms.

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**File:** `Task_3(CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION).ipynb`

In this task, I developed a model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns. The model helps in identifying customers who are likely to leave the service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

### Task 4: Spam SMS Detection

**File:** `Task_4(SPAM_SMS_DETECTION).ipynb`

This task involves building a model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). The dataset includes SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. I used various natural language processing techniques and classification algorithms to build an effective spam detection model.

## Installation

To run the notebooks locally, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
