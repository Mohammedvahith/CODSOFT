## Introduction

This repository includes machine learning models and projects that I developed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project is organized in its own directory with relevant code.

## Projects

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

**File:** `Task_1(Movie_Genre_Classification).ipynb`

**Description:** Created a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using NLP techniques and classification algorithms.

**Techniques Used:** TF-IDF

**Classifiers:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression

**Directory:** Movie Genre Classification

**Dataset:** Movie Genre Dataset

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**File:** `Task_2(CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction information.

**Techniques Used:** Decision Trees, SMOTE

**Directory:** Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Dataset

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**File:** `Task_3(CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics.

**Techniques Used:** Gradient Boosting

**Directory:** Customer Churn Prediction

**Dataset:** Customer Churn Dataset

### Task 4: Spam SMS Detection

**File:** `Task_4(SPAM_SMS_DETECTION).ipynb`

**Description:** Built an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate using techniques like TF-IDF with the Naive Bayes classifier.

**Techniques Used:** TF-IDF

**Classifiers:** Naive Bayes

**Directory:** Spam SMS Detection

**Dataset:** SMS Spam Dataset

## Installation

To run the notebooks locally, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
