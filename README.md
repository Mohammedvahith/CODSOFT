## Overview

This repository showcases the work done during my internship at CodSoft. The tasks involve building and evaluating machine learning models for various applications. Each task is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing a detailed, step-by-step approach to solving the problem.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

**File:** `Task_1(Movie_Genre_Classification).ipynb`

**Description:** This task involves developing a machine learning model to classify movies into different genres based on their descriptions. The dataset used includes movie plots and corresponding genres. Various natural language processing techniques and classification algorithms were employed to achieve high accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Bag of Words, TF-IDF
- Classification Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Scikit-learn, NLTK

**Steps:**
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature extraction using NLP techniques
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Hyperparameter tuning

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**File:** `Task_2(CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION).ipynb`

**Description:** This task focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transaction details labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The goal is to build a model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions.

**Technologies Used:**
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Classification Algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Imbalanced Data Handling Techniques (e.g., SMOTE)
- Scikit-learn

**Steps:**
1. Data exploration and visualization
2. Handling imbalanced data
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Performance metrics and model improvement

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**File:** `Task_3(CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION).ipynb`

**Description:** In this task, a model is developed to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns. The model helps in identifying customers who are likely to leave the service.
